Personal assessment week 8

READ ME! Hello fellow developer!

This read me will give you a better understanding of my beat-tracker project and my website.

Setup

This Setup will only be for MACs because I dont know how to do it for Windows, Sorry PC users!

Specs: I am using Mac OSX yosemite 10.10.1 and the text editor Sublime text 2 along with the 

terminal using AngularJS v1.3.13 and Angular-ui-router v0.2.13 and Safari web browser.

Create a folder called beat-tracker and copy the folders and names of the files in my repository into it.

You now should have a beat-tracker folder with five folders and two files (not including the README).

Make sure lib has two files, controllers has 2, partials has 2, services has 2 and css has 2 with all the right endings.

To begin you will need to open a python server in the terminal. Now go to localhost:8000 and you should see my app there.

You are ready to go! You should now be able to enter what type of beats you want and get the reporters working on that beat!
